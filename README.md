What the hangman game does play hangman against a computer player. Each blank space represents a letter that hasn't been guessed. When your player guesses correctly it's displayed on the screen.

Currently your player only guesses the letter "A".  You will edit `YourPlayer.java` in an effort to make it a better Hangman player. The player's code can be found in `YourPlayer.java` and the tests can be found in `YourPlayerTest.java`. You are not allowed ot change anything else.
